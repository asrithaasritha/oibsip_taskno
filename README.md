Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales
Performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover key trends, customer behavior, and product performance. Utilized time series analysis, demographic segmentation, and category-level insights to drive actionable business recommendations. Presented findings using visualizations like line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to support strategic decision-making.

 Project 2: Data Cleaning on Airbnb NYC Dataset
Cleaned and prepared the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing column formats, and identifying outliers. Focused on ensuring data quality and consistency to make the dataset suitable for analysis. Exported a fully cleaned CSV ready for downstream tasks like EDA or modeling.

Project 3: Wine Quality Prediction
The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to analyze physicochemical properties of red or white wine samples to predict their quality rating. By applying machine learning techniques, we explore how factors like acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol level affect the overall quality of wine, which is usually rated on a scale from 0 to 10.
